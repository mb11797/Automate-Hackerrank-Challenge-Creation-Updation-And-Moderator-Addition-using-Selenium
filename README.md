# Automate-Hackerrank-Challenge-Creation-Updation-And-Moderator-Addition-using-Selenium
Automated the Hackerrank challenges creation and also new moderators addition in existing Hackerrank challenges. This is done in order to reduce the amount of redundant work being done in case of creating 100s of individual challenges (questions) by manual copy & pasting the data for challenge (question) and also in the case of moderator addition which requires navigating each and every challenge manually to just add one or more moderators. This project is made to make the work automated, thereby playing smart while avoiding labour work.
